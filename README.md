## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned a lot during this project.  I tried to implement some of the things I have learned about sizing em and rem values.  


```css
.block-2 {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  margin: 1.5rem;
  width: 19rem;
  padding: 0.2em;
  border-radius: 0.75rem;
  background-color: $very_pale_blue;
  // border: 1px dotted blue;
}
```
### Continued development

I have found a passion and am excited about learning.  I am learning a lot from different places.  There is so much great infomation out there.  I am so glad to be a part of these communities for learning.

### Useful resources

- [box shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - I referenced this for shadows around the button element.
- [background-repeat](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background_repeat.asp) - I refenced this site for main background image.
